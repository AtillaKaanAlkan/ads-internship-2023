On 8 Apr 23, MAXI detected an outburst from Swift J0243.6+6124 and the X-ray flux is exhibiting a steady increase and is being monitored by various instruments in X-rays like Swift, NICER and by the VLA at radio wavelengths (ATels #15983, #15984, #15987, #16076, #16101, #16121, #000, #11346). NuSTAR observed the source for ~46 ks starting at MJD 60122.54 (2023-06-27, 12:56:48 UTC, ObsID 90901321002) in an intermediate brightness phase when the Swift/BAT rate in the 15-50 keV was around 1 Crab. Although there were 5 NuSTAR observations of the source during the 2017 outburst, they covered the low and high luminosity states, and this is the first time that NuSTAR covered the rising phase of the outburst with a luminosity of 1.6 x 10^38 erg/s assuming a source distance of 6.8 kpc (Bailer-Jones et al. 2018, AJ, 156, 58).

We extracted the NuSTAR light curves and spectra using a source extraction region of ~120 arc-sec around the source centroid, and a similar sized background extraction region far away from the source. The lightcurves were background subtracted and times were corrected to solar system barycenter. From the lightcurves, we find that the hardness ratio between the energy bands of 12-70 keV and 3-12 keV, remained constant throughout the NuSTAR observation. The NuSTAR light curves show pulsations of 9.7991 (+/-0.0001) seconds. This is consistent with the fact that the pulsar is spinning up as luminosity increases, as evident from the long-term Fermi/GBM spin period evolution of the source. The pulse profile exhibits a single peak throughout the NuSTAR energy range with a notch during the falling flank, presumably consistent with the location of a secondary peak before MJD 60117 (Atel #16121). We fit the pulse profiles with two Gaussians and calculate their pulse fraction as (Imax-Imin)/(Imax+Imin), where Imax, Imin are the maximum and minimum intensities, respectively. The pulse fraction increases with energy, and the peak dominating the pulse profile gets narrower with increasing energy. The pulse fraction below 7 keV is ~ 25%, from 7-30 keV is ~35%, and from 20-70 keV is ~52%. No orbital corrections were performed on the lightcurves. 

Long term MAXI light curves from Terzan 1 showed that the 4-10 keV base-line count rate has been increased from < 10 mCrab to 20-30 mCrab since around MJD 58950 (September 28, 2022). An outburst with a peak of 70-80 mCrab is recognized for MJD 60020-60050 (March 17-Aprill 16, 2023) as reported on March 21 (ATel #15955, #15957). The recent activity was also detected by LEIA in June (ATel #16108).

This transient is most likely to be the low-mass X-ray binary X1732-304 (a.k.a. XB 1732-304, 1RXS J173546.9-302859) (see ATel #13983; #13991). The globular cluster Terzan 1, however, contains 12 or 14 X-ray sources in a radius of 1.4 arcmin (Cackett et al. 2006, MNRAS, 369, 407). We tentatively name the source MAXI J1735-304b. Followup observations are encouraged.

The source region was hardly observed from June 24 to the detection time on June 26. Thus the outburst may started before the detection. The source position is consistent with that of the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1739-278 if the additional systematic uncertainty is taken into account. GRS 1739-278 exhibited a bright and long outburst in 2014 (ATel #5986, #5991). Continuous low (< 20 mCrab) activity in the hard state was also observed since 2016 (ATel #9517, #9541, #10137, #11869). On the other hand, such a soft X-ray spectrum likely in the soft state was not observed at the beginning of the outburst in 2014 (e.g., Yan and Yu 2017, MNRAS, 470, 4298; Wang et al. 2018, PASJ, 70, 67), suggesting this transient source is a new X-ray transient. We therefore tentatively name the source MAXI J1741-276.
