### General Presentation of The Astronomers' Telegram (ATel) System

The Astronomer's Telegram publication system (ATel) is a communication channel enabling to share and report astronomical discoveries for the benefit of the whole professional astrophysicists' community \cite{ATelNetwork}. The ATel system overcomes this challenge by making available observation reports (the so-called "telegrams") posted by observers on the web portal instantaneously. Therefore, this system provides verifiable information while minimising the distribution time and maximising the availability of posted telegrams. All reports are free to access and free to use.
