 Our team continue regular observing of the blazars sample in search of possible correlation between its optical and radio activity events using 1-meter Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-meter RC-500 reflectors, equipped with BVRI CCD photometers.

Our data, taken with these telescopes in January-February, showed that brightness of S4 0133+47 had been varied about R~16.4 magnitude. After period of blazar's invisibility in March-June we inspected it's brightness at June, 28th and July, 7th. The object was in a low state, showing brightness between R~17.2 and 17.5 magnitudes. Within 8-day interval between July 06th and July 14th the blazar became as bright as R ~16.0. Our studies during the last week showed that S4 0133+47 became brighter and achieved R~15.40 +/- 0.02 magnitude at epoch MJD=60146.0 (July 20/21 night). Data from RC-500 for epoch MJD=60147.95 (July 22/23) gave almost the same value: R=15.38 +/- 0.02.

So, in course of two last weeks the blazar increased its brightness by 2 magnitudes and possibly will start decreasing phase within a few days. Results from the both telescopes are agreed within out photometric accuracy: between 0.01-0.02 magnitudes for individual frames.

All photometrical data were calibrated by us using by our own reference stars (see ATel #15626). Our last estimates of blazars brightness from RC-500 telescope were performed using by Andor iXon Ultra EM-CCD camera instead of a larger, but less effective front-illuminated FLI camera, which was used since 2021 January.

More accurate reduction is necessary. We strongly encourage further multi-wavelength observations.
